2. Create the following in your main directory:
- Directory `include` for your header (`.h/.hpp`) files.
- Directory `src` for your implementation (`.c/.cpp`) files.
- Create a `main.c`/`main.cpp` file in the `src` directory with your main function.
- File `CMakeLists.txt`
3. Copy this template into your `CMakeListsFile.txt` file:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(<project name>)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "src/*.c" "src/*.cpp")
add_executable(<executable file name> ${SOURCES})

include_directories(include)
```
Replace `<project name>` and `<executable file name>` with your desired names.
